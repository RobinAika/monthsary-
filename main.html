	When I see you and your smile
This is how I feel
I feel Roses and Sunflowers spread out on a pretty field
When you say that I'm your guy
My whole world turns to you
I'm stuck with this feeling and I'm never turning blue
You're a flower that's blooming every season with spring
I fell in love with your roots, the whole you, everything
You give me those butterflies
Wish I could keep them in a jar
So I could take you with me no matter where you are, oh
My love, my love, my love will never go to waste
Your heart, your heart, your heart, you know I'll keep it safe
Oh my love, my love, my love will never go to waste
Your heart, your heart, your heart, you know I'll keep it safe
Ooh, ooh
When I see you and your smile
This is how I feel
I feel Roses and Sunflowers spread out on a pretty field
When you say that I'm your guy
My whole world turns to you
I'm stuck with this feeling and I'm never turning blue
You're a flower that's blooming every season with spring
I fell in love with your roots, the whole you, everything
You give me those butterflies
Wish I could keep them in a jar
So I could take them with me no matter where you are, oh
My love, my love, my love will never go to waste
Your heart, your heart, your heart, you know I'll keep it safe
Oh my love, my love, my love will never go to waste
Your heart, your heart, your heart, you know I'll keep it safe
Ooh, ooh
We're living under the same skies
Same Sun and Moon, only different times
I'm missing the way your hand fits into mine
All of the time I'm missing
I'm missing you
Track suits and red wine
Movies for two
We'll take off our phones
And we'll turn off our shoes
We'll play Nintendo
Though I always lose
'Cause you'll watch the TV
While I'm watching you
There's not many people
I'd honestly say
I don't mind losing to
But there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you
Dumb conversations
We lose track of time
Have I told you lately
I'm grateful you're mine
We'll watch The Notebook
For the 17th time
I'll say "It's stupid"
Then you'll catch me crying
We're not making out
On a boat in the rain
Or in a house I've painted blue
But there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you
So shut all the windows
And lock all the doors
We're not looking for no one
Don't need nothing more
You'll bite my lip and
I'll want you more
Until we end up in a heap on the floor
Mmm
You could be dancing on tabletops
Wearing high-heels
Drinking until the world
Spins like a wheel
But tonight your apartment
Had so much appeal
Who needs stars?
We've got a roof
But there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you
Mmm
No, there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you
I'm saying things I don't believe
And your love casts its shadow on the things I do
And I can hear so clearly all the words I wish I said
You're stuck in my head
But I only think of you
Will we be together soon?
I'm thrown to the wayside
You're planted in my mind
But I don't wanna be okay without you
Now I can't find the words to say
That'll be the perfect balance between loud and clear
And I can hear so well, your lovely voice inside my head
Saying you love me, oh
But I only think of you
Will we be together soon?
I'm thrown to the wayside
You're planted in my mind, alright
But I don't wanna be okay without you
But I only think of you
Will we be together soon?
I'm thrown to the wayside
Oh, you're planted in my mind
But I don't wanna be okay without you
Without you...
No, I don't wanna be okay without you
I don't stand in line, I don't pay for clubs, fuck that, yeah
But I'll wait for you
I don't like to drink, I don't like to think, fuck that, oh-oh
But I ponder you, oh
I'm bending it over
You're my four-leaf clover
I'm so in love, so in love
There's no one above, up above
Forever's a long time, yes
My blue jeans
Will last me all my life
Oh, yes
So should we
I'm spending all, yeah, this time
Oh
Met you at the shop, sun was gettin' hot, I'm lonely (lonely), yeah (yeah)
I'm in the city on my own (city on my own)
Never would've thought you'd be the one, I got a homie (oh)
But that's the way it goes (that's the way it goes)
I'm reaching nirvana (I'm reaching nirvana)
Goodbye sweet Rwanda (goodbye sweet Rwanda)
High school was never for me (high school was never for me), yeah
I say let it be, let it be (oh)
Forever's a long time (a long time), yeah
My blue jeans
Will last me all my life
Oh, yes
So should we
I'm spending all this time
You don't even know me
You don't even know me, yes
I'm hanging from the tree
I'm hanging from the tree
Darling, don't move too much
'Cause you might break the things that you have touched
But let me tell you, don't go too far
And just enjoy this artistic room of ours
This empty canvas, that they misunderstood
I wanna paint you in it, but I'm not good
'Cause I wanna look at you when we are apart
'Cause you're not just a human being, you are art
So darling, darling don't be scared
'Cause even if I look everywhere
Your colors caught my eye
And you're my favorite sight to see
It's from the way that you move
And everything that you do
And after that it's when I realize
That I love you
You told me to look everywhere else
But I said no, 'cause when I look at you
My heart always melts
So I stayed even though you're a mess
'Cause you're like drugs and with you
Yeah, I'm obsessed
So, darling, darling, don't be scared
'Cause even if I look everywhere
Your colors caught my eye
And you're my favorite sight to see
It's from the way that you move
And everything that you do
And after that it's when I realize
That I love you
Darling, darling, don't be scared
'Cause even if I look everywhere
Your colors caught my eye
And you're my favorite sight to see
There's no life, without love they say
None worth having anyway, you're a mystery to me some days
But that's what keeps me sane, the heart that yearns is always young
But you can't love just anyone, it's been a while since 21, but I still feel the same
So take me home, don't spare the horses
Away to the silence I need
Take me home, don't spare the horses
Away to a gossamer breeze
I don't need to build a house of stone
'Cause wherever you are's where I call home
'Cause we're just you me, can drink and laugh and dance 'till 3
'Cause I have everything I need, when I'm with you alone
Home is where we stay all night, no roof above our starry sky
I'd lie here 'till the day I die, and our time together's flown
So take me home, don't spare the horses
Away to the silence I need
Take me home, don't spare the horses
Away to a gossamer breeze
I don't need to build a house of stone
'Cause wherever you are's where I call home
And I know I've made mistakes at times, every now and then I've made you cry
For that I'm sorry, but they were few and far between
We're closer now than we've ever been, and you know I'm sorry
I used to wonder, why I'm here, no rhyme no reason would appear
But since we've met, it's loud and clear, I'm here to see you, home
Will it be a pavement or a sidewalk
When I finally lay my eyes on you?
Someone I've already loved
will you find your way out of the blue?
Will it be my flat or your apartment
When I finally realize I do?
Will we meet on Baker Street
Or find ourselves on Melrose Avenue?
I don't know who you are
But I'll save you a seat
Hang my coat on a chair next to me
I tried to reassure the waiter
Say you're down the street
He laughed at me
So here's to you
The most beautiful thing that I have never seen
Someone on a screen asked me a question
Something about what love means to me
Maybe it's just circumstance
Or general compatibility
I don't know who you are
But I'll save you a seat
Hang my coat on a chair next to me
I tried to reassure the waiter
Say you're down the street
He laughed at me
So here's to you
The most beautiful thing that I have never seen
When we're out in a crowd laughing loud
And nobody knows why
When we're lost at a club, getting drunk
And you give me that smile
Going home in the back of a car
And your hand touches mine
When we're done making love
And you look up and give me those eyes
'Cause all of the small things that you do
Are what remind me why I fell for you
And when we're apart, and I'm missing you
I close my eyes and all I see is you
And the small things you do
When you call me at night while you're out
Getting high with your friends (high with your friends)
Every "hi", every "bye", every "I love you" you've ever said
(You've ever said)
'Cause all of the small things that you do
Are what remind me why I fell for you
And when we're apart, and I'm missing you
I close my eyes and all I see is you
And the small things you do
When we're done making love
And you look up and give me those eyes
'Cause all of the small things that you do
Are what remind me why I fell for you
And when we're apart, and I'm missing you
I close my eyes and all I see is you
And all I see is you and the small things you do
All the small things you do
I would need a million words
If I tried to define
All the things you mean to me, yeah
For you I'd die a thousand lives
Special kind of energy
'Cause love is born when hearts collide
Every time you touch me
You remind me that I'm still alive
So promise you'll never change
And I'll always be the same
We'll be dancing the same groove
When we're ninety-two, the same as seventeen
And I'll never lie to you
Just don't you hold back on me
I wanna love you as strong
When we're ninety-two, the same as seventeen
I don't really know what's right
But I can never call you wrong
I just wanna dance with you
Floating over marble floors
You're something like an angel
You do something to my mind
I can see a thousand years
When I'm looking in your eyes
So promise you'll never change
And I'll always be the same
We'll be dancing the same groove
When we're ninety-two, the same as seventeen
And I'll never lie to you
Just don't you hold back on me
I wanna love you as strong
When we're ninety-two, the same as seventeen
Just promise you'll never change
And I'll always be the same
We'll be dancing the same groove
When we're ninety-two, the same as seventeen
And I'll never lie to you
Just don't you hold back on me
I wanna love you as strong
When we're ninety-two, the same as seventeen
Hmm pag-usapan muna natin ang iyong gabi
Ikaw ang pahinga ko mahal
Lumiliwanag aking ngiti
Kapag kausap na
Kita pasensya lang kung
Babalik pa rin sa atin
Kahit 'di mo 'ko hanapin
Magpapaalipin lang sa 'yo
Pinapawi mo ang uhaw ng aking puso
Oh sabik sa lalim
Ng pagtingin mo para sa 'kin
'Pag napansin mo na ako
Ipapaunawa ko agad sa 'yo na
Isa lang isa lang (isa lang)
Ang hinahanap ko hanap ko (hanap)
Ikaw ra man ikaw ra man
Kung papalarin na mapapasa'kin ba
Kung saan-saan man magtungo 'di alam kung ba't sa puso
Pangalan mo lang ang tanging laman
Hindi alam kung ba't mas sinusunod mo pa ang iyong mga tala
At 'di ang nararamdaman sa akin ngunit
Babalik pa rin sa atin
Kahit 'di mo 'ko hanapin
Magpapa-alipin lang sa 'yo
Pinapawi mo ang uhaw ng aking puso
Oh sabik sa lalim
Ng pagtingin mo para sa 'kin
'Pag napansin mo na ako
Ipapaunawa ko agad sa 'yo na
Isa lang isa lang (isa lang)
Ang hinahanap ko hanap ko
Ikaw ra man ikaw ra man
Kung papalarin na mapapasa'kin ba
Kung mang-aakit akit ka na naman
Pwede bang sa akin akin lang
Kung mang-aakit akit ka na naman
Pwede bang sa akin akin lang
Kung mang-aakit akit ka na naman
Pwede bang sa akin akin lang
Isa lang isa lang
Ang hinahanap ko hanap ko
Ikaw ra man ikaw ra man
Kung papalarin na mapapasa'kin ba
Sa araw-araw
Tanging ikaw ang
Palagi kong hinahangad
Laging tanaw sa 'yo ang ilaw
Na nagsisilbi kong liwanag
Labis ang ngiti kapag ika'y kaharap
Ramdam ko ang pagmamahal giliw
Namumukod-tangi ka at walang katulad
Ikaw lang ang para sa 'kin
Sa 'yo lang sa 'yo lang ako uuwi
Kaya naman
Dito ka sa piling ko
O dito ka lang
Dito ka lang
Bumabagal ang ikot ng mundo
Kapag ika'y nariyan
O aking tahanan
Ta ta ta ta ta tahanan
Dito ka lang
Dito ka lang
Dito ka lang
O aking tahanan
Latatadatadatadada mmm
Sa bawat sandali
Na tayo ay magkayakap nang mahigpit
Taglay mong init ang bumabalot sa 'king
Nilalamig na damdamin
Tayong dalawa'y pinagtagpo
Ng tamang pagkakataon
Hindi maitatanggi
Na sa akin ikaw ang tanging
Tiyak ah
Ikaw lang ikaw lang ang tinatangi (ikaw lamang ang tinatangi ko)
Ikaw lang at ako ang
Naaaninag (naaaninag)
Sa gitna ng paraiso na
Ating sinimulan
O aking tahanan
Pinapawi lahat ng iyong mga ngiti
Negatibo na nakadikit sa 'king labi
Huli ng iyong ngiti ang aking kiliti
Katotohanan na hindi ko maitatanggi
Na mahal kita
Walang iba
Kaya naman
Dito ka sa piling ko
O dito ka lang
Dito ka lang
Bumabagal ang ikot ng mundo
Kapag ika'y nariyan
O aking tahanan
Ta ta ta ta ta tahanan
Dito ka lang
Dito ka lang
Dito ka lang
Dito ka sa piling ko oh (pinapawi lahat ng iyong ngiti negatibo na nakadikit sa 'king labi)
Bumabagal ang ikot ng mundo (huli ng iyong ngiti ang aking kiliti katotohanan na hindi ko maitatanggi)
Ta ta ta ta ta tahanan
Dito ka lang
Dito ka lang
Dito ka lang
O aking tahanan mm
I won't run out of songs to tell you I love you
And I won't be done 'til you say I do
And when we grow old babe
Heaven will know that we made it through
Just me and?you
It's?the?way you say?hi
When you do?you're kind of shy
But not the times when you're with me
And you're too loud when you laugh
When you're talking with your hands
And I just want you to kiss me
But maybe there's more to this little story
Cause I won't run out of songs to tell you I love you
And I won't be done 'til you say I do
And when we grow old babe
Heaven will know that we made it through
Just me and you
And every time we say goodbye
You hold my hand too tight
And then you cry when I kiss you
And every letter that you sign
Theres a heart over the I'
Each time you write I miss you'
When you're lying next to me
And you're talking in your sleep
You're so damn sweet when you're dreaming
And the mornings we wake up
When we've had a bit too much
We made love til the evening
But maybe there's more to this little story
Cause I won't run out of songs to tell you I love you
And I won't be done til you say I do
And when we grow old babe
Heaven will know that we made it through
Just me and you
I know it's not very cool
Standing here, serenading like a fool
But I don't care
I'll gladly be a fool for you
I know the idea isn't new
To fall in love with someone on first view
But I don't care
I think I'll fall in love with you
I'll put on my Sunday best
You pick out your favorite dress
I'll take you somewhere new
I'll be old fashioned for you
It's a cliché, or so I'm told
To give your jacket up to someone when it's cold
But I don't care
I don't mind the midnight air
Oh, oh
I'll walk you home, to your front door
I'll say, "Farewell", until the morning calls
I'll be smiling a bigger smile than before
I'll put on my Sunday best
You pick out your favorite dress
And I'll take you somewhere new
I'll put on my Sunday best
You pick out your favorite dress
I'll take you somewhere new
I'll be old fashioned for you
You don't know, babe
When you hold me
And kiss me slowly
It's the sweetest thing
And it don't change
If I had it my way
You would know that you are
You're the coffee that I need in the morning
You're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring
Won't you give yourself to me
Give it all, oh
I just wanna see
I just wanna see how beautiful you are
You know that I see it
I know you're a star
Where you go I follow
No matter how far
If life is a movie
Oh you're the best part, oh oh oh
You're the best part, oh oh oh
Best part
It's the sunrise
And those brown eyes, yes
You're the one that I desire
When we wake up
And then we make love
It makes me feel so nice
You're my water when I'm stuck in the desert
You're the Tylenol I take when my head hurts
You're the sunshine on my life
I just wanna see how beautiful you are
You know that I see it
I know you're a star
Where you go I follow
No matter how far
If life is a movie
Then you're the best part, oh oh oh
You're the best part, oh oh oh
Best part
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
Won't you
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
Love me, won't you
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
Love me, won't you
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
If you love me won't you say something
If you love me won't you
Love me, won't you
Oh, baby
Oh, man
You're makin' me crazy
Really drivin' me mad
That's alright with me
It's really no fuss
As long as you're next to me
Just the two of us
You're my, my, my, my kind of woman
My, oh my, what a girl
You're my, my, my, my kind of woman
And I'm down on my hands and knees
Beggin' you please, baby
Show me your world
Oh, brother
Sweetheart
I'm feelin' so tired
Really fallin' apart
And it just don't make sense to me
I really don't know
Why you stick right next to me
Wherever I go
You're my, my, my, my kind of woman
My, oh my, what a girl
You're my, my, my, my kind of woman
And I'm down on my hands and knees
Beggin' you please, baby
People say we shouldn't be together
We're too young to know about forever
But I say, "They don't know
What they're talk-, talk-, talking about" (talk-, talk-, talking about)
'Cause this love is only gettin' stronger
So, I don't wanna wait any longer
I just wanna tell the world that you're mine, girl, oh
They don't know about the things we do
They don't know about the I-love-yous
But I bet you if they only knew (they don't know)
They would just be jealous of us
They don't know about the up-all-nights
They don't know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right (they don't know)
Baby, they don't know about, they don't know about us
One touch, and I was a believer
Every kiss, it gets a little sweeter
It's getting better
Keeps getting better all the time, girl
They don't know about the things we do
They don't know about the I-love-yous
But I bet you if they only knew (they don't know)
They would just be jealous of us
They don't know about the up-all-nights
They don't know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right (they don't know)
Baby, they don't know about, they don't know about us
They don't know how special you are
They don't know what you've done to my heart
They can say anything they want
'Cause they don't know about us
They don't know what we do best
That's between me and you, our little secret
But I wanna tell 'em
I wanna tell the world that you're mine, girl
They don't know about the things we do
They don't know about the I-love-yous (I love you)
But I bet you if they only knew (if they only knew)
They would just be jealous of us (they would just be jealous of us)
They don't know about the up-all-nights
They don't know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right (feels so right)
Baby, they don't know about, they don't know about
They don't know about the things we do (they don't know about us)
They don't know about the I-love-yous (they don't know about us)
But I bet you if they only knew (they don't know about us)
They would just be jealous of us
They don't know about the up-all-nights
They don't know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby, they don't know about, they don't know about us
They don't know about us
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my
Lover
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Lover
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my
Lover
I found a love, for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it
Darling, you look perfect tonight
Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a lover, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this
Darling, you look perfect tonight
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
Listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight
Watching the video that you sent me
The one where you're showering with wet hair dripping
You know that I'm obsessed with your body
But it's the way you smile that does it for me
It's so sweet, knowing that you love me
Though we don't need to say it to each other, sweet
Knowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair
It's so sweet
Watching the video where you're lying
In your red lingerie ten times nightly
You know I think your skin's the perfect color
But it's always your eyes that pull me under
It's so sweet, knowing that you love me
Though we don't need to say it to each other, sweet
Knowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair
It's so sweet
And I will gladly break it
I will gladly break my heart for you
And I will gladly break it
I will gladly break my heart for you
And I will gladly break it
I will gladly break my heart for you
And I will gladly break it
I will gladly break my heart for you
It's so sweet, knowing that you love me
Though we don't need to say it to each other, sweet
Knowing that I love you, and running my fingers through your hair
It's so sweet
Nobody knows
Just why we're here
Could it be fate
Or random circumstance
At the right place
At the right time
Two roads intertwine
And if the universe conspired
To meld our lives
To make us
Fuel and fire
Then know
Wherever you will be
So too shall I be
Close your eyes
Dry your tears
'Cause when nothing seems clear
You'll be safe here
From the sheer weight
Of your doubts and fears
Weary heart
You'll be safe here
Remember how we laughed
Until we cried
At the most stupid things
Like we were so high
But love was all that we were on
We belong
And though the world would
Never understand
This unlikely union
Why it still stands
Someday we will be set free
Pray and believe
When the light disappears
And when this world's insincere
You'll be safe here
When nobody hears you scream
And I'll scream with you
You'll be safe here
Save your eyes
From your tears
When everything's unclear
You'll be safe here
From the sheer weight
Of your doubts and fears
Wounded heart
When the light disappears
And when this world's insincere
You'll be safe here
When nobody hears you scream
I'll scream with you
You'll be safe here
Ooh ooh
In my arms
Through the long cold night
Sleep tight
You'll be safe here
When no one understands
I'll believe
You'll be safe
You'll be safe
You'll be safe here
Put your heart in my hands
You'll be safe here
Watch the sunrise along the coast
As we're both getting old
I can't describe what I'm feeling
And all I know is we're going home
So please don't let me go, oh
Don't let me go, oh-oh-oh
And if it's right
I don't care how long it takes
As long as I'm with you
I've got a smile on my face
Save your tears, it'll be okay
All I know is you're here with me
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Watch the sunrise as we're getting old, oh-oh
I can't describe, whoa-oh
I wish I could live through every memory again
Just one more time before we float off in the wind
And all the time we spent
Waiting for the light to take us in
Have been the greatest moments of my life
I don't care how long it takes
As long as I'm with you, I've got a smile on my face
Save your tears, it'll be okay,
Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me
But bear this mind, it was meant to be
And I'm joining up the dots, with the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me
I know you've never loved
The crinkles by your eyes when you smile
You've never loved your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
But I'll love them endlessly
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if I do, it's you
Oh, it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you
And all these little things
You can't go to bed without a cup of tea
And maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me
I know you never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much you weight
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you
It's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you
And all these little things
You'll never love yourself half as much as I love you
And you'll never treat yourself right darling, but I want you to
If I let you know, I'm here for you
Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you, oh
And I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth
'Cause it's you, oh, it's you
It's you, they add up to
And I'm in love with you
And all these little things
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you
It's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you
And all your little things
Oh, kay gandang pagmasdan
Ang iyong mga mata
Kumikinang-kinang
'Di ko maintindihan
Ang iyong mga tingin
Labis ang mga ningning
Langit ay bumaba
Bumababa pala ang tala
Tumingin ka sa 'king mga mata
At hindi mo na kailangan pang
Magtanong nang paulit-ulit
Ikaw lang ang iniibig
At kung 'di kumbinsido'y magtiwala ka
Hawakan ang puso't maniwala
Na ikaw lang ang s'yang inibig
Ikaw lang ang iibigin
At sa iyong paglalambing
Ako ay nahulog din
'Di ko alam kung ano ang gagawin
'Di ko alam kung saan titingin
Halik sa labi
Tinginan natin
'Di akalaing
Mahuhulog ka sa 'kin
Tumingin ka sa aking mga mata
At hindi mo na kailangan pang
Magtanong nang paulit-ulit
Ikaw lang ang iniibig
At kung 'di kumbinsido'y magtiwala ka
Hawakan ang puso't maniwala
Na ikaw lang ang s'yang inibig
Ikaw lang ang iibigin, sinta
At sa paglisan ng araw, akala'y 'di ka mahal
At ang nadarama'y hindi magtatagal
Malay ko bang hindi magpapagal
Iibigin kita kahit ga'no pa katagal
Tumingin ka sa 'king mga mata
At hindi mo na kailangan pang
Magtanong nang paulit-ulit
Ikaw lang ang iniibig
At kung 'di kumbinsido'y magtiwala ka
Hawakan ang puso't maniwala
Na ikaw lang ang s'yang inibig
Ikaw lang ang iibigin
You were looking at me like you wanted to stay
When I saw you yesterday
I'm not wasting your time, I'm not playing no games
I see you
Who knows the secret tomorrow will hold?
We don't really need to know
'Cause you're here with me now, I don't want you to go
You're here with me now, I don't want you to go
Maybe we're perfect strangers
Maybe it's not forever
Maybe the night will change us
Maybe we'll stay together
Maybe we'll walk away
Maybe we'll realize
We're only human
Maybe we don't need no reason
Maybe we're perfect strangers
Maybe it's not forever
Maybe the night will change us
Maybe we'll stay together
Maybe we'll walk away
Maybe we'll realize
We're only human
Maybe we don't need no reason why
Come on, come on, come over
Maybe we don't need no reason why
Come on, come on, come over
No one but you got me feeling this way
There's so much we can't explain
Maybe we're helping each other escape
I'm with you
Who knows the secret tomorrow will hold?
We don't really need to know
'Cause you're here with me now, I don't want you to go
You're here with me now, I don't want you to go
Maybe we're perfect strangers
Maybe it's not forever
Maybe the night will change us
Maybe we'll stay together
Maybe we'll walk away
Maybe we'll realize
We're only human
Maybe we don't need no reason
Maybe we're perfect strangers
Maybe it's not forever
Maybe the night will change us
Maybe we'll stay together
Maybe we'll walk away
Maybe we'll realize
We're only human
Maybe we don't need no reason why
Come on, come on, come over
Maybe we don't need no reason why
Come on, come on, come over
Come on, come on, come over
Maybe we don't need no reason why
Come on, come on, come over
I'll be the one that stays 'til the end
And I'll be the one that needs you again
And I'll be the one that proposes in a garden of roses
And truly loves you long after our curtain closes
But will you still love me when nobody wants me around?
When I turn 81 and forget things
Will you still be proud?
'Cause I am the one who's waited this long
And I am the one that might get it wrong
And I'll be the one that will love you
The way I'm supposed to, girl, oh
But will you still love me
When nobody wants me around, around?
When I turn 81 and forget things
Will you still be proud?
Proud of me, of my short list of accomplishments, say
And me and my lack of new news
Me and my selfishness, oh, me and myself
Wish you nothing but a happy new version of you
Because I, I, mm-mmh
Mm-mm-mm, mm
I want you to tell me
You find it hard to be yourself
So I can say it's gonna be alright, yeah
And I want you to love me the way you love your family
The way you love to show me what it's like to be happy
I paid all my dues
And she wanted to know
That I'd never leave her
Now I'm ready to go
And strange as it seems
She's endless to me
She's just like paperwork
But harder to read
Patience, my enemy
And loving's my friend
It's harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
I made all my plans
And she has made hers
She kept me in mind
But I wasn't sure
I searched every room
For a way to escape
But every time I try to leave
She keeps holdin' onto me for dear life
And blocking my way
Patience, my enemy
And loving's my friend
It's harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
And like the back of her hand
She already understands everything
Won't you stay? She says
And she already knows how it goes
And where she stands
I'll stay, anyway
'Cause she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
Oh, she knows me so well
HELLO MAHAL KO HAPPY MONTHSARY PO PRESS 1 IF KITA MO ITO HAAHAHAHAHAH I LOVEE YOUU SUPERR!!!
